PyMarietje
----------

PyMarietje is a client for MarietjeD.  MarietjeD is a music Daemon originally
written in C++ and used by the student associations of the science faculty
at the Radboud University Nijmegen.

At the moment the only client, is a curses client.

Also, the only supported protocol is the `classic` (or: dumb) protocol.

MarietjeD has been reimplemented in Python by a project called MarieD.  See
